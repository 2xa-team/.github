# about the team 🏡  
2xa is a small team of heartfelt village devs who want to make the internet better. We’re working towards an internet that’s safe and free for everyone.  

## about us 🛠️  
We’re a group of folks who love tinkering with tech. We’ve got a product — a VPN based on VLESS. It helps us earn a bit, and we plan to keep improving it. But what really drives us are ideas and projects that give people more freedom and security online.  

## our mission 🏴‍☠️  
We dream of an internet without censorship or surveillance. One where everyone can decide for themselves how to be online, without extra limits. Our slogan — *anonymously/progressively* — reflects our push for security and fresh ideas for all.  

## what we have 🔓  
- **VPN on VLESS** — a simple working product that does some good.  
- Lots of plans and directions we want to grow in.  

## open projects 🚧  
We’re all about open source and will share our work on GitHub down the road. Our repos are open to check out what we’re up to, and ideas are welcome if anyone feels like pitching in.  

## how to join 🧑‍💻  
We’re always happy to connect with those who want to help or just chat about ideas. As enthusiasts, we value any interest in what we do.  
- Repos have tasks tagged *good first issue* or *help wanted*.  
- Thoughts can be dropped in issues.  
We officially communicate in English, but we’re a Russian-speaking team — Russian will come in handy for closer collaboration. Excited to welcome new folks!  

## contact us 📬  
Communication happens via GitHub: comments or issues (in English). We’re open to questions, suggestions, and new team members — people of any skill set.
